Welcome to pyG2's documentation!
================================

PyG2 is a python library that introduced **Grammar of Graphics** into Jupyter Notebooks. It is constructed wrapping javascript 
charting library G2 designed by AntV team.

With the use of PyG2 you can generate large number of charts without memorizing different functions for each and every function.
PyG2 makes it more easier and logical to generate charts.

Leland Wilkinson's concept **grammar of graphics** simplifies graphic generations identifying the pipelined process of graphic
generation. With grammar of graphics we can switch to a logical way of specifying graphics rather than using ad hoc specification patters.
